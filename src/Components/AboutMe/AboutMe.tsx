              Hello, my name is Marley. I've always been extremely interested in
              technology and the way things worked, which drove me to choose web
              development as my ideal career of choice.

              After doing some online courses I enrolled in a Full Stack
              Development Course with Le Wagon. Throughout my studies I worked
              with Git/Github, HTML, CSS, Javascript, APIs, Active Record, SQL
              Queries and Ruby On Rails, building and deploying web
              applications.

              Prior to studying, I worked at Flight Centre Travel Group for over
              7 years. Throughout my time I worked within various roles
              including 5 years in the leadership team where I have developed a
              broad set of transferable soft skills.

              Since leaving Flight Centre Travel Group, I have been fortunate
              enough to join the wonderful team at Exo Digital, a Melbourne
              based web design and development agency.
